# Day 9 - SOC Analyst Challenge

**Objective:**  
Today's challenge focuses on installing and configuring Sysmon on the Windows Server machine created during Day 5. Sysmon plays a crucial role in monitoring and detecting malicious activities by logging various system events.

## Steps:

1. **Sysmon Installation:**
   - Downloaded the latest version of Sysmon (v15.15).
   - Connected to the Windows Server machine via Remote Desktop.
   - Navigated to Sysmonâ€™s official page on Microsoft Learn to download the binaries.
   - Extracted the Sysmon binaries and prepared them for configuration.

2. **Sysmon Configuration:**
   - Obtained a widely-used Sysmon configuration file from Olaf's GitHub repository.
   - Downloaded the `sysmon-config.xml` file and saved it in the Sysmon directory.
   - Opened PowerShell as an administrator and navigated to the Sysmon directory.
   - Installed Sysmon using the following command:
     ```bash
     sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmon-config.xml
     ```
   - Verified successful installation by checking the Sysmon service and confirming the generation of logs in Event Viewer.

3. **Verifying Logs:**
   - Opened Event Viewer and navigated to `Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon`.
   - Confirmed that Sysmon was logging events, including event ID 3 (network connections).

## Key Takeaways:

- Sysmon is now actively monitoring system events on the Windows Server.
- Understanding Sysmon's event logs, such as network connections (Event ID 3), helps in analyzing potential security incidents.
- This configuration lays the groundwork for integrating logs into Elasticsearch, which will be covered in upcoming days.

---

## Next Steps:
- In the next session, I'll integrate Sysmon and Microsoft Defender logs into the Elasticsearch instance. This will further enhance our ability to analyze and visualize the data for incident response.

Stay focused, and let's keep building toward a robust security monitoring setup.
