Day 23: Implementing a Ticketing System for Alert Management
As part of my 30-day SOC Analyst Challenge, I'm excited to share insights on the importance of tracking alerts triggered in security tools. Keeping a record of these alerts is crucial for identifying potential misconfigurations, attacks, and the responses to each alert.

What is a Ticketing System?
A ticketing system serves as a centralized platform for managing various requestsâ€”whether they be alerts, customer complaints, or troubleshooting inquiries. It plays a key role in ensuring:

Task Tracking: Maintain visibility on all open tasks.
Audit Trail: Provide a historical record of actions taken.
Accountability: Establish clear responsibilities among team members.
Choosing osTicket
For this challenge, I have decided to work with osTicket, an open-source ticketing system that rivals commercial products like Jira and ServiceNow. Here are some features that make osTicket a great choice:

Customization: Tailor fields and workflows to meet specific needs.
Ticket Routing: Automatically direct tickets to the appropriate team members.
SLA Management: Set service level agreements to ensure timely responses.
By integrating osTicket into my tech stack, I can effectively simulate a small SOC environment, gaining practical experience along the way.

Next Steps
In the upcoming days, I will focus on setting up and configuring osTicket to fully utilize its capabilities in managing alerts. This hands-on experience will significantly enhance my skills in alert management.

If you're on a similar journey, I encourage you to explore osTicket as well!
