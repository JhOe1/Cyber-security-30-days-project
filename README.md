# 30-Day Cybersecurity SOC Analyst Challenge

Welcome to my **30-Day Cybersecurity SOC Analyst Challenge** repository! This project is a reflection of my journey to enhance and showcase my cybersecurity skills as I aim to become a more proficient SOC Analyst. Over the next 30 days, I will tackle real-world security operations scenarios, gaining hands-on experience with tools and techniques critical for the role.

## Purpose

The goal of this challenge is to document my skills in detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents. Each day, I will work on tasks that simulate actual SOC operations, helping me build a portfolio that demonstrates my capabilities to prospective employers.

## What This Challenge Covers

By the end of this challenge, I will have developed a well-rounded understanding of various aspects of a SOC analyst's role, including:
- Setting up and configuring an ELK (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana) stack for log analysis.
- Detecting and investigating security incidents, including malware infections and brute-force attacks.
- Creating and configuring alerts and dashboards to monitor security threats.
- Setting up and managing a ticketing system for incident tracking and response.

### Weekly Breakdown

#### **Week 1: ELK Stack Setup and Log Ingestion**
- Set up the ELK stack and ingest logs from endpoints.
- Learn to create dashboards for log visualization.

#### **Week 2: Brute-Force Attack Detection**
- Configure a public SSH and RDP server.
- Detect and investigate brute-force attempts.
- Create alerts for early detection.

#### **Week 3: Command & Control (C2) Detection**
- Set up a Mythic C2 server and simulate attacks.
- Analyze command and control traffic.
- Investigate and mitigate malicious activity.

#### **Week 4: Ticketing System and Incident Investigations**
- Integrate a ticketing system for incident management.
- Perform in-depth investigations into simulated security incidents.
- Document findings and mitigation steps.

## Skills and Tools Demonstrated

Throughout this challenge, I will be showcasing the following skills and tools:
- **Security Monitoring:** Using Elasticsearch and Kibana to monitor logs for security incidents.
- **Incident Response:** Investigating and responding to attacks such as malware infections and brute-force attempts.
- **SIEM Setup:** Configuring a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using the ELK stack.
- **Cloud Security:** Deploying and securing public-facing cloud environments.
- **Automation:** Automating alerts and ticket creation for incident management.

## Why This Challenge Matters

As a cybersecurity professional, it's important to not only have theoretical knowledge but also hands-on experience. This challenge allows me to apply what Iâ€™ve learned and demonstrate my ability to solve practical problems in a SOC environment. By sharing this journey, I aim to provide prospective employers with insight into my problem-solving abilities, my familiarity with industry-standard tools, and my commitment to continuous learning.

## Repository Structure

- **Main Repository:** Contains the overall plan and day-by-day progress.
- **Daily Folders:** Each day has its own folder with detailed write-ups, code, and configurations used during the challenge.
